Project Overview:
The "ThinkBravely" game is a fun, interactive app that presents users with absurd, humorous, and creative scenarios. 
Users will select one of the ridiculous answer options for each scenario, and the app will generate a funny result based on their choice. 
The app aims to entertain and engage users with quirky, random situations and responses. This light-hearted game can be played alone or shared with friends to see how they would respond to the same scenarios.
The goal is to provide endless laughter, creativity, and a distraction from everyday life
