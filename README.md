        Project Title:

"What Would You Do?" - The Absurd Scenario Game

Project Overview:
The "What Would You Do?" game is a fun, interactive app that presents users with absurd, humorous, and creative scenarios. Users will select one of the ridiculous answer options for each scenario, and the app will generate a funny result based on their choice. The app aims to entertain and engage users with quirky, random situations and responses. This light-hearted game can be played alone or shared with friends to see how they would respond to the same scenarios. The goal is to provide endless laughter, creativity, and a distraction from everyday life.

Key Features:
Random Absurd Scenarios:

The app generates a variety of scenarios for the user to respond to, such as "What would you do if you turned into a penguin for a day?" or "You're stuck in a room with an angry llama. How do you escape?"

Based on the user's amswers, the app will provide a funny result or outcome, such as: “You moonwalked so hard you broke the space-time continuum!”
Users might receive "rewards" in the form of points, achievements, or unlockable scenarios.
Shareable Results:

After completing scenarios, users can share their humorous results on social media, along with the scenario and their answer. For example: "I just got turned into a penguin for a day! #EpicFail" Leaderboard (Optional):

Users can accumulate "adventure points" based on the creativity of their responses, which could be displayed on a leaderboard. The leaderboard will track the most creative answers to scenarios.
Daily Challenges:

A "Daily Challenge" feature that generates a unique scenario every day, encouraging users to come back regularly and continue playing.
Customizable Preferences:
Users can select their favorite types of scenarios (e.g., fantasy, absurd, animal-related) for more tailored experiences. Tech Stack: Frontend:

React.js: To build the dynamic user interface where scenarios and choices are displayed. CSS/SASS: For styling the app and ensuring the UI is playful, quirky, and responsive. Axios: Backend (Optional for Advanced Features):

Node.js with Express.js: For handling user data, leaderboard functionality, and storing daily challenges or user responses.
MongoDB: For storing user profiles, adventure points, and leaderboards. This database can also track daily challenges. External APIs (Optional):

Fun Scenario Generator API: If you want more dynamic content, you can use a fun random scenario generator API, or you can manually create a database of predefined scenarios.

Why This Project:
Fun and Entertaining: This app is designed to keep users engaged and laughing. It offers a break from the everyday by presenting them with bizarre and humorous scenarios. It’s a simple concept that’s sure to provide hours of fun.

Interactive and Shareable: The app allows users to share their results with friends and challenge them to answer the same questions, which creates a fun social experience. It’s designed to encourage virality, as users will want to share their bizarre responses.

Easy to Start, but Scalable: For beginners, this is a great project to work on. The basic functionality (random scenarios and options) is simple to implement, but you can add more complexity as you learn, such as a backend for user data or integrating a more advanced recommendation system.

Creativity and Humor: This project allows you to exercise your creativity in both the content (creating the scenarios and responses) and the design (styling the app to be fun and visually appealing).

Tech Learning: You’ll practice working with React for building the dynamic UI, Axios for handling API calls, and if you choose to add a backend, you'll get hands-on experience with Node.js and MongoDB. Plus, you’ll learn how to store and manage user data in a fun way!
